Core mod for the On Ancient Ground modpack available on both Modrinth and Curseforge.

# Data Gen Note

Since the mod and modpack's assets are built around using the Vexxed Visuals resource packs found [here](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/vexxed-visuals-terrafirmacraft), it needs to be included when running datagen. 
Download the pack and copy the "tfc" folder within the packs "assets" folder, into "src/extra/assets" and datagen should now run as it can now include those files.
In-Game you should have the resource pack enabled and at the very top load order. (for those who are unfamiliar with dev instances, the resource pack folder is in the "run" folder).
